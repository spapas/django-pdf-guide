# django-pdf-guide

This is a sample project that accompanies the "PDFs in Django: The essential guide" article @ http://spapas.github.io/2015/11/27/pdf-in-django/

There are three versions: A django 1.8 version with tag ``django-1.8``, a django 2.0 version with tag ``django-2.0`` and a ``django-2.1`` version. To use one or the other just ``git checkout tag``. Notice that there are no real differences between the django 2 and django 2.1 version beyond the requirements.
